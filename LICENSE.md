# THE "DO WHATEVER THE FUCK YOU WANT " LICENSE

## Version 6.9, January 2025

<aside>
By reading this unnecessarily long license agreement for a Discord bot that nobody actually reads anyway, you hereby acknowledge that you're probably wasting your time, but hey, here we are.

## TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR LITERALLY ANYTHING YOU CAN POSSIBLY IMAGINE WITH THIS BOT

### 1. BASIC SHIT

- Want to use this bot? Fucking go for it.
- Want to modify its code? Have a blast.
- Want to sell it? Whatever, I don't care.

### 2. EXTENDED SHIT NOBODY ASKED FOR

- You can translate its responses into Klingon

- You can make it roleplay as a medieval knight
- You can make it tell dad jokes (but should you?)

### 3. WARRANTY BULLSHIT (OR LACK THEREOF)

> This Discord bot is provided "AS IS" because obviously. If it spams your server, deletes your emojis, or starts a robot uprising - that's your problem, not mine. No refunds, no complaints, no crying to Discord support.

### 4. LIABILITY STUFF THAT LAWYERS PROBABLY CARE ABOUT

> In the event that something goes catastrophically wrong (and let's face it, it probably will), the developer accepts absolutely zero responsibility. Like, seriously, none. Not even a little bit. You're on your own, buddy.

### 5. THINGS YOU COULD DO BUT PROBABLY SHOULDN'T

- Use this bot to start a cult
- Claim you coded this (but who would want to?)
- Make it spam other bots
- Try to teach it human emotions

### 6. CONCLUSION AND OTHER MEANINGLESS WORDS

By this point, you've wasted several minutes of your life reading this bot license. Congratulations! You could have been doing literally anything else, like actually using the bot. But since you're still here, remember: you can do whatever the fuck you want with this bot. Seriously. Anything. I mean it. Stop reading and go bot.
